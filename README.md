# Pokemon_Project--Java
UPDATE: Created a new Pokemon project using Spring Boot Java for backend and React as frontend.
In order to use the front end portion, you need to download the node_modules folder because that contains all the styling of the frontend portion such as Bootstrap.


OLD: This is a Pokemon themed project. It has two parts. Pokemon.java defines variables and methods 
to create a mini battle between two pokemons. Pokemon_Demo.java tests these methods.
